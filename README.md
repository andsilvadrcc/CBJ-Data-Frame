# CBJ-Data-Frame

The general objective of this research plan is to study hadronic interactions produced by
particles of cosmic radiation, with energy of up to 10$^{17}$ eV, in the laboratory frame, 
and compare it with the results obtained by experiments on accelerators and with the 
prediction of the Monte Carlo event generators (PYTHIA and EPOS LHC). Specifically, we 
intend to study the elementary processes produced by proton-proton, proton-carbon and 
proton-lead collisions by generators in the region frontal (or fragmentation region) 
through energy distributions and multiplicity in pseudo-rapidity (angle) for comparison 
with data collected by the Brazil-Japan Collaboration (CBJ). This project is a natural 
continuation of the work carried out in the master's degree in 2016. It should be noted 
that this type of study with CBJ data and its comparison with accelerator data has not 
been done so far.

# Introduction

We are presenting here the full experimental data of
extremely high energy local nuclear interactions of cosmic-
rays observed by emulsion chambers exposed at Mt. Chacaltaya
Observatory, Bolivia, of altitude 5200 m above sea levell).
The observed interactions are in the range of incident energy
around 100 TeV.

The emulsion chamber experiment of Brasil-Japan Collaboration
has been making, since 1962, a series of exposures of emulsion
chambers of various types at Mt. Chacaltaya.

Study on nuclear interactions in the target layer, which
here, is rr,ade with emulsion chambers of two

the target layer and the presence of air gap, gamma-rays generated 
in a C-jet penetrate through the target layer without
materialization and arrive at the level of lower detector with
large enough mutual distances among them.
This makes a contrast with the shower development in a homogeneous
material, where the two electron showers from a
merge with each other.
